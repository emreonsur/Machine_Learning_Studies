# Machine Learning Studies

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Studies** repository! This is where I document my learning process in machine learning, following various online resources.

## Study Approach

This is how I approach my machine learning studies:
1. **Following the Content**: I watch or read tutorials and carefully go through the explanations to understand the concepts.  
2. **Reimplementing from Scratch**: Instead of copying code, I write everything from scratch to reinforce my understanding.  
3. **Working on Examples**: I modify the examples, test different inputs, and analyze the results.  
4. **Doing the Exercises (If Available)**: I complete the exercises provided in the tutorials to solidify my understanding.
